"""``fastapi/no-raw-request-parsing`` -- reject reading the body off ``Request``.

Flagged: ``request.json()``, ``request.form()`` and ``request.body()`` -- with or
without ``await`` -- called inside a route handler on a name that lexically resolves
to a parameter of *that* handler annotated ``Request`` (bare, ``fastapi.Request``,
``starlette.requests.Request``, quoted, or wrapped in ``Annotated[...]``).

Not flagged, all for the same reason -- nothing proves the receiver is the handler's
own request object, or that this code is handler code:

* the same calls in a function that is not a route handler (a middleware, a helper,
  a test), including a nested function defined inside a handler: the *nearest*
  enclosing ``def`` decides;
* a receiver that is not a ``Request``-annotated parameter (an unannotated one, a
  module-level object, an attribute chain);
* ``request.stream()``, ``request.headers``, ``request.query_params`` and the rest of
  the request API: this rule is about parsing the *body*, not about touching the
  request object at all -- a handler that genuinely needs the raw stream is doing
  something the signature cannot express.
