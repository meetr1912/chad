"""``fastapi/no-dict-body-parameters`` -- reject a route body typed as a mapping.

The framework-specific form of ``no-any-parameters``/``no-unsafe-dict-values``,
reported with the recipe that actually applies: a pydantic model.

Flagged: a parameter of a route handler (see ``_routes.py`` for what counts as one)
whose annotation is ``Any`` or a dict-like container -- ``dict``, ``Dict``,
``Mapping``, ``MutableMapping``, ``defaultdict`` -- bare, subscripted, attribute
qualified (``typing.Mapping[str, Any]``), or quoted (``"dict[str, Any]"``). The
``Annotated[dict[str, Any], ...]`` spelling is unwrapped first.

Not flagged:

* A parameter marked as something other than the body -- ``Depends``, ``Security``,
  ``Query``, ``Header``, ``Path``, ``Cookie`` -- in either spelling, as a default
  value (``q: dict = Query(...)``) or as ``Annotated`` metadata. Those values do not
  come from the body, so a mapping there is a different question from this one.
  ``Body``/``Form``/``File`` are deliberately *not* in that exemption list: a
  parameter marked with them is the body.
* ``*args``/``**kwargs``: neither is a body parameter, whatever it is annotated with.
* A parameter with no annotation at all -- FastAPI treats it as a query parameter,
  and ``no-any-parameters`` already speaks about missing contracts in general.

A quoted annotation is read as text, not re-parsed, so only its head name is matched.
