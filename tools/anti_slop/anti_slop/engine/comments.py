"""Comment extraction and suppression parsing.

``ast`` discards comments, so the comment map is built from ``tokenize``. The same
map serves ``require-safety-comment`` (phase 2), which needs the raw text of the
comment attached to a line.

Supported directives::

    # anti-slop: ignore[rule-id]            suppress on this line or the next line
    # anti-slop: ignore[rule-a, rule-b]     suppress several rules at once
    # anti-slop: ignore[fastapi/rule-id]    an opt-in group rule, by its full id
    # anti-slop: skip-file                  skip the file (first 5 lines only)

A suppression without a rule id is a configuration error, not a silent blanket
"turn everything off".

Two further primitives sit on top of the same map, for phase 2
("Ключевые решения движка"):

* :func:`safety_comment_for` -- does a safety comment cover this AST node? The
  marker is ``SAFETY`` followed by a colon and the invariant it states; an empty one
  states nothing and does not count. Coverage looks at the node's own line and at the
  comment block above it, then at the same two places for the *statement that owns*
  the node -- the port of the original's ``commentOwnerKinds`` list, which in ``ast``
  is simply the ``ast.stmt`` base class. :func:`safety_invariant_at` and
  :func:`safety_above` are the two halves, usable on a bare line number for callers
  (such as a comment directive) that have no node to climb from.
* :func:`checker_suppressions` -- every type-checker suppression in the file, in the
  portable spelling and in the ty and pyright dialects, read from the token stream
  rather than from ``ast.parse(type_comments=True)`` so that codes and positions come
  from the same place as every other comment.
