"""Diff mode: restrict findings to the lines a change actually touched.

``--diff <base>`` answers the question an agent asks right after editing a file --
"did *I* just introduce something?" -- and it answers it about the **working tree**,
not about ``HEAD``. An edit that has not been committed yet is exactly the edit worth
checking; comparing only committed history would report a clean run on the code
sitting in the editor. So the default compares the current checkout (staged, unstaged
and untracked alike) against the merge base with ``<base>``.
``--diff-committed <base>`` is the strict variant for CI, comparing the merge base
with ``HEAD`` and nothing else.

Mechanically::

    git rev-parse --show-toplevel
    git merge-base <base> HEAD
    git diff --unified=0 --no-color --no-renames --no-ext-diff <merge-base> [HEAD]
    git ls-files --others --exclude-standard          # working-tree mode only

Every flag is passed explicitly rather than relied upon as a default, because the
defaults are the user's to change: ``diff.renames`` turns rename detection on, an
external diff driver replaces the format wholesale, and ``diff.noprefix`` removes the
``a/``/``b/`` prefixes this module parses. A deterministic invocation matters more
than a short one. ``GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0`` keeps a read-only query from taking the
index lock, so running this alongside an editor's own git integration cannot fail on
a lock it never needed.

The unified-diff headers are parsed here, with the standard library, rather than by
asking git for a machine format it does not have. Only the *new* side matters: a
diagnostic survives the filter when its anchor line is one of the lines the change
added or rewrote. A finding spanning several lines is judged by its anchor line
alone, the same line every format reports as its location -- a multi-line construct
whose anchor was not touched is not this change's finding.
