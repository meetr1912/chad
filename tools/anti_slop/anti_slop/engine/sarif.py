"""SARIF 2.1.0 output: one machine-readable JSON document for CI systems and
static-analysis viewers that already speak the OASIS format.

The document mirrors ``format_json`` (FR-4, in ``runner.py``) in what it reports --
the same diagnostics, in the same sorted order, the same severity mapping -- but
shapes it into SARIF's ``run`` model: one ``tool.driver.rules`` entry per rule that
produced at least one result (never the whole registry, so a reader never has to
cross-reference rules nothing found), and one ``results`` entry per diagnostic with a
``SRCROOT``-relative artifact location.

    ``rules`` is the rule set the run executed under; only the rules that produced at
    least one diagnostic are reproduced in ``tool.driver.rules``, sorted by
    :func:`~anti_slop.engine.catalog.listing_key` -- SARIF readers resolve a result's
    ``ruleId``/``ruleIndex`` against that array, not against every rule this
    distribution ships. ``root`` becomes ``SRCROOT`` in ``originalUriBaseIds``, and
    every artifact location is written relative to it.

    ``diagnostics`` is expected already sorted the way :func:`~anti_slop.engine.
    runner.format_json` expects it -- by ``(path, line, col, rule_id)`` -- and is
    reproduced in that order, so calling this twice on the same run produces
    byte-identical output. An empty ``diagnostics`` still produces a complete,
    valid document with empty ``rules``/``results`` arrays.

    ``fingerprints`` supplies each result's ``partialFingerprints`` value. A caller
    that already computed them -- the CLI does, for baseline mode -- passes them in so
    the source files are read once; omitting the argument computes them here, so every
    result carries one either way.
