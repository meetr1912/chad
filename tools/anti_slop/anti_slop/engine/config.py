"""Configuration: the ``[tool.anti-slop]`` section of ``pyproject.toml``.

Everything invalid is loud: an unknown rule id, an unknown option, a wrongly typed
option or an unknown level is a configuration error (CLI exit code 2), never a
silently ignored line.

``groups`` is the one key that changes *which rules exist*. Each entry names a
subpackage of :mod:`anti_slop.contrib` whose ``__init__`` exposes ``GROUP_RULES``
(rules whose ids are prefixed with the group name) and ``CORE_MESSAGE_OVERRIDES``
(replacement message templates for core rules, so a framework group can give a core
rule its own recipe). Enabling a group appends its rules to the effective registry --
:attr:`Config.registry` -- at ``error`` by default; leaving ``groups`` out reproduces
the core-only behaviour exactly.

``preset`` is the one key that changes *which levels rules start at*. It reads the
tier and confidence of each core rule's metadata and hands out levels accordingly
(see :data:`PRESETS`); ``[tool.anti-slop.rules]`` then overrides the result rule by
rule, so a preset is a starting point and never the last word. Leaving ``preset`` out
is not a preset -- every rule starts at ``error``, exactly as before presets existed.
