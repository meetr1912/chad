"""``require-safety-comment`` -- every cast and every checker suppression states its invariant.

Port of ``require-safety-comment-for-type-assertion``. There are no exemptions:
TypeScript's ``as const`` has no Python counterpart, and ``cast`` is unsafe by
construction -- unlike ``isinstance``, it checks nothing at runtime, it only silences
the checker.

Three independent defects are reported:

``cast``
    a ``cast(...)`` call with no ``# SAFETY:`` comment covering it. Coverage follows
    :func:`~anti_slop.engine.comments.safety_comment_for`, which also accepts a
    comment above the *owning statement* -- the port of the original's
    ``commentOwnerKinds``, so a cast buried inside a multi-line expression is still
    covered by the comment above that expression's statement.

``suppression``
    a ``# type: ignore`` / ``# ty: ignore[...]`` / ``# pyright: ignore[...]`` with no
    ``# SAFETY:`` on its own line or in the comment block directly above it. There is
    no node to climb from, so the owning-statement fallback does not apply: a
    directive suppresses exactly the line it sits on.

``bare_type_ignore`` / ``bare_suppression``
    a suppression that names no error code. This check is deliberately independent of
    the ``# SAFETY:`` check, so a bare ``# type: ignore`` with no safety comment
    reports twice -- once for the missing invariant, once for the missing code. They
    are separate defects with separate fixes.

Not a checker suppression: anti-slop's own ``# anti-slop: ignore[rule-id]``. It names
a rule of *this* linter, is already required to name it, and is parsed
by a different directive grammar entirely.

Known limitation, shared with ``no-chained-casts``: callee detection is syntactic --
a bare name ``cast`` or any attribute access ending in ``.cast``.
