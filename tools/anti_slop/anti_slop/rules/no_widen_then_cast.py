"""``no-widen-then-cast`` -- reject "widen the type, then cast it back".

Port of ``no-widen-then-assert``, the longest rule of the original. The pattern is a
three-step local flow inside one scope::

    u: User = load()          # 1. a binding with a narrow, proven type
    raw: Any = u              # 2. an explicit widening of that binding
    user = cast(User, raw)    # 3. the narrow type claimed back by force

Step 3 is what gets reported, because that is the line that fabricates the evidence;
the message names the whole chain so the fix (delete step 2) is visible from the
diagnostic alone.

A direct ``cast(User, u)`` with no widening in between is *not* this rule -- it is a
plain unverified assertion, which ``require-safety-comment`` handles.

What counts as each step
------------------------

**Step 1, a narrow binding.** An ``AnnAssign`` with a value and an annotation that is
not ``Any``/``object`` (``u: User = load()``), an ``Assign`` of a constructor call
(``u = User(...)``, recognized by the callee's name starting with a capital -- a
heuristic, since a syntax-only rule cannot know what is a class), or a parameter of
the enclosing function carrying a non-``Any``/``object`` annotation. Parameters count
deliberately: ``def handle(u: User)`` is exactly as proven as ``u: User = load()`` --
it is the checker's own guarantee -- so widening a parameter and casting it back is
the same round trip and is reported.

**Step 2, an explicit widening.** An ``AnnAssign`` whose annotation *is* ``Any`` or
``object`` and whose value is a bare name from step 1 (or from a previous step 2, so
``u`` -> ``raw`` -> ``boxed`` chains are followed). A plain ``raw = u`` is not a
widening: it carries no annotation, so the checker still knows the type and nothing
was thrown away.

**Step 3, the cast back.** ``cast(T, raw)`` (or ``cast("T", raw)``) on a widened name,
where ``T`` is any type other than ``Any``/``object`` -- casting back to ``Any``
claims nothing narrow and is not this pattern. The target need not be the original
type: the round trip is the defect, not the choice of destination.

Scope and conservatism
----------------------

Analysis is straight-line and per scope: the statement lists of the module body and
of each function body, in order. It never descends into ``if``/``for``/``while``/
``with``/``try``/``match`` bodies, and never crosses a function boundary -- each
nested function is analysed on its own, with its own parameters as seeds, so a chain
started in an enclosing scope cannot be completed inside a closure. Class bodies are
not analysed either; methods inside them are, as functions.

Any statement that stores into a tracked name -- including a compound statement that
assigns to it somewhere inside its branches -- drops that name from the analysis. So

.. code-block:: python

    u: User = load()
    raw: Any = u
    if fallback:
        raw = fetch_raw()
    user = cast(User, raw)     # not reported: `raw` may no longer come from `u`

stays silent. The bias is deliberate: a missed round trip costs nothing, a false one
teaches the reader to ignore the linter. Lambdas and nested ``def``\\ s inside an
otherwise straight-line statement are skipped when looking for casts, for the same
reason -- their bodies run later, under a binding this pass cannot see.

Callee detection for ``cast`` is syntactic, with the same known limitation as
``no-chained-casts`` and ``require-safety-comment``: a bare name ``cast`` or any
attribute access ending in ``.cast``.
